# Job interview assignment
We kindly ask you to solve the task below. By solving and submitting this assignment you provide us with insights in how you solve real-world problems. What we will be looking at is topics such as: choice of technology, structuring of code, use of VCS, selection of 3rd party libraries, documentation etc.

## The task
Develop a solution that, given a select query, can read data from a database, write it to a local file and then delete the data from the database. The solution should verify that data is written to the file before deleting it from the database.

- Use Bash, PHP, JavaScript or Go as the language
- Use MySQL, MariaDB, CockroachDB or SQLite as the database

Please use the data set provided in the SQL dump in this repo.

## Expectations
Fork this repo. Solve the task below. Push your code to a public repo and send us the link via email or simply send us a tarball (please include any VCS metadata) in an email to pf@cego.dk.

Your solution should include a short readme describing your solution, how to use/test it and any final considerations such as known errors, next steps, security concerns etc. Donâ€™t worry we are not expecting this thing to be perfect.
